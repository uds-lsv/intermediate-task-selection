{"text":"one still works fine , the other quit after one day .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"apex 's website is down and they wo n 't answer their phone .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture ! .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"seemed like a good deal , but this pps frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , `` no disc `` .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"this is extremely lame .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"* main dial is not backlit .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"4 ) the viewfinder is bordered lcd skying .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens ti gt and cause potential damage .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan 't up to the task .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the grain was terrible .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"about the only legitimate criticism from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the included memory card is too small .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"it is made of plastic .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get over illuminated main subjects with depth being lost .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"and the body \/ construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"when i went to put in the new sd card i looked at the lcd screen -- cracked -- and the fluid gave a jackson pollock type appearance to the screen , black and blue and purple blotches and streaks -- useless .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"some more manual control would have been nice .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the only knock i have is that the flash is underpowered .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"after 57 pictures total the lcd went black except for the icons showing the settings .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight camera shake is a problem to contend with .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the sd500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months , and the lcd has been broken twice .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"the controls are hard to manipulate , especially in the dark .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the only thing i don 't like is the small size ( 8 meg ) memory card that comes with it .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"i have to move pictures off of it every day so i have room for more pictures the next , and i don 't have enough money to buy the 256 meg card that i 've had my eye on for a while .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"first off , the battery .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in . . . wrong ! .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"controls are a bit awkward .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore `` the `` when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"it also has unproven battery life .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"not so nice things : - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing ( outside of a table ) - the 1\/4 `` chuck sleeve requires much tightening to keep bits from slipping","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"all in all , not very good .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the only not-so-positive comment i have is about the depth adjustment , it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"i replaced it with a router raiser and it works much better .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"two , the single wrench just doesn 't work well .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the sliding latch is does not stay in place .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the fine adjustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the `` sliding wrench `` which comes on the router .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"it would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"the ipod mini is smaller and sexier , albeit limited in supported formats and the rio karma is a far better value .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"while the software may not be as easy as i-tunes , it is not difficult to use by any stretch .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"if i was pressed to find a negative aspect of the zen micro i would probably have to mention weak fm reception , but the building where i primarily use the micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway , so you can take that for what it 's worth .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well , and as i never had issues getting songs transferred to the player , i did have problems accessing them from the player .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all > i would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"if someone asked me flat out , i 'd say to go woth something else .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"i 've since replaced it with a pair of black sennheisers . . . not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable , but are too similar to ipod 's and can target ipod thieves here in nyc .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"it 's perfect for those who aren 't planning on storing tons of music .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"screen review could be better .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"the fm radio 's reception isn 't spectacular , but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"00 % good though , and the zen does have a few drawbacks .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"while transferring songs to the player , the interface has crashed a few times ( 4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period ) normally this would cause me major concern , but it appears that this bug is reproducible , which leads me to believe that creative will fix it with a patched version shortly ( or maybe it 's just my computer ) .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"another thing i don 't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"after consulting with creative 's customer support , they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair , which would cost me $ 40 , since it 's past the 90 day warranty ( pretty short warranty ) .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"they obviously have quality and reliability problems .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"they have a good concept here , and i normally expect a lot better quality from creative , so maybe they will do better with the next gen version , but for now i say buyer beware .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"es , the interface took a little getting used to , but once i did , it 's almost second nature now .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"only slight negatives i 've had so far is that i haven 't been able to get it to accept any of my wav files yet .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"yes , there is a belt clip , but that doesn 't hold the extra battery and usb cable .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"it barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzes all over the player , because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"it is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"on the downside , i think the interface takes some getting used to and the zen software ! .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"is not as intuitive as i would like .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"also , the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable ( although my wife didn 't have a problem ) , so i bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"his is what i get for my $ 200 on this mp3 player ? .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"as for the zen micro : \\ cons : i read that every button is touch sensitive , and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"putting the micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything ( unless the hold feature is improved : it asks if you want to `` unholy `` for every button up press ) second , i 'm worried about the durability of the player .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"after research of other creative hard drive players , i found that most of them aren 't very durable and tend to crash ( read most reviews on amazon . com and see for yourself ) .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"verdict : had i not needed something with a tad bit more space , i consider this player fair game .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"whatever . . . on to the negatives : -touchy about charging . . . you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it 's life if you don 't upgrade the firmware or dont ' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"it has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working ? .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"-user 's guide doesn 't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"i tried to use the fm radio option , but it doesn 't seem to really pick up the stations i listen , however i am going to try it in a different location , it may have just been my residential location .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"even when i set it to low , it 's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what i want it to do .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"i 've read about the issues with the scroll bar , but they must have taken care of that now .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"another problem is that the latest 2 . 0 firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player 10 which seems to be very , very slow for downloads . charging [ -2 ]","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"if you buying this player to use with napster to go , wait a while .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"a lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for napster to go . . the firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"imagine my disappointment , though , when the zen micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest fm signals in my area .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"it seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the micro to pull in a strong sound .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"still , that 's enough time that i 'm still satisfied , if a bit grouchy with creative 's over hyped promises .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable ( and they included a second one free ) .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of `` ear buds `` .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"unfortunately i was wrong .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"within one month , my player completely died .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"( it had locked up multiple times previously , but always managed to work after wards ) this time , the touch screen wouldn 't respond to me and none of the buttons worked .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"i sent creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don 't seem to even want to help .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"it 's too bad , though , that ! .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the included headphones suck , so get your own .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the touch sarene navigation will take a little getting used to , but once you do , and while the zen is still alive , it 's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"just too numerous to list : fm radio , which has weak reception , but at least it there , and a microphone , to name just two .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"but , the creative zen micro is plagued by a serious , serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw , and i 'm going to tell you what it is . . . but first , two more things about this piece of garbage that 's so great and could 've made it a potential ipod killer .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"but , all of this means nothing , because of the serious , serious , stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw : after 3 months , give or take a few weeks , you won 't be able to hear anything .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"because the `` engineers `` at creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"again , the headphone jack on this thing is garbage .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"again , this is a design flaw in the headphone ! .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the flaw is inside the zen .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the creative zen micro is a zen micro killer , not an ipod killer .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20gb ipod that will hold 4 times the number of songs ( and even more if aac encoding is used ) for the same price ? . ? . ? .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"to use the creative zen player with a subscription service , you need to go to creative 's web site , and download new software for your pc .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"right now , the creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"this doesn 't affect standard mp3 files - just subscription wma files .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer , but it 's only by about 10 % or so .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"again , this doesn 't affect regular mp3 files - just subscription drm-encoded files , like those from napster-to-go or yahoo music unlimited .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"i don 't know , maybe i got a defective one but first , the player would not shut off , next , the player would not come on - i had to send it away to get repaired .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone else 's is too .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"8mb for a camera like this is a joke .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the only disappointment so far has been battery life .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"mine generally requires a charge every 48 hours or so and i don 't really talk on it that much .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"i purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of nokia phones available .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"anyhow some demerits of this phone , the phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most nokia variants .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"video recording is limited at just 9 seconds .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"you can upgrade but then there 's a certain level of trouble involved .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"i 've had nokia 's for years , and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"on the plus side it 's packed with features , including bluetooth that works fine - it 's really a tiny computer that is also a phone . . . and that 's the negative .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"as a computer , or pda its weak since the screen , while large by phone standards , is still tiny to really do anything on .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"when you dial a number , you 'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"i hope you have a magnifying glass , because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"i must say , this one is quite slow to open an application .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"sometimes , it needs few minutes to open an application .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"but not good enough for me .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"i have overall been disappointed with nokia in the past , finding that samsung and motorola tended to have better quality phones .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"the photos in the address book are terribly scaled too ; . they look as though they were built out of lego 's .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"it 's important that people know the following : first , the interface is slow .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"secondly , in addition to the lag each time you give a command , it 's just not that easily use able on the go .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area , the fonts are small , the interface is too convoluted and frustrating , it 's not that customizable as well .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"this phone is not suitable for fast people , maybe only for old people .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"when i finally got it working , it only worked properly for many a month .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"the next problem was that it didn 't recognize all the installed components , so it would not update them , most notably and importantly , virus definitions .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}
{"text":"but this doesn 't make up for it 's innumerable other short-comings , the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with liveupdate .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"as of october , 2004 , these products are not working and i 'm ready to demand a refund from symantec .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"then when i went to norton 's website to obtain a priority id number per the instructions i had been given , i couldn 't find a way to get one .","label":0,"label_text":"negative"}

{"text":"its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it plays alternate video formats ( cads , svcds , cods ) very well .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and amazon . com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ? .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e . , mp3s ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it sure does ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"that 's a rare and valuable feature .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"it looks great - and is loaded with features .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . )","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"while i would like to give it 3 . 5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"even viewed cds full of jogs .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"because of it 's hidden features ( no macro vision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - \/ + r 's .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i find this to be a great feature .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"for the money apex machines have good features .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vb files which i created with smart ripper .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the af feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3\/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"loved the slim design .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"audio is excellent .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"simple to use and hook up .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n 't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"for the most part this is a good dvd player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch wide screen dvd 's to normal .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this thing plays everything i feed it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n 't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it does n 't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jv players .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"unlike some of the other people who received a `` lemon `` , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this player seems to work fine with everything else .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r\/rw and dvd-r \/ rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r\/rw and another supports - r\/rw ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"so much packed in a small case and very affordable ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"there are a lot of things i like about it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it works great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"amazon is awesome ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"besides the one problem , this machine is amazing ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it plays everything , even vcd 's .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i will never use all the `` whistles and bells `` this machine is capable of .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"but for what i do use it is perfect .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the dvd player is fine .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"good looks","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"also , very light and portable .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it will read and play all cd audio disc .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"also , it was only $ 39 . 99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"good quality video .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"mixed bag i guess but the price was right .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the build quality feels solid , it does n 't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dots and dd5 . 1 sound good ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n 't had any problems .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"works great ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"silverfish color really adds a special touch .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i am really impressed by this dvd player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thus far ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1\/2 x 11 with no vi sable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense \/ filters choices .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( almost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall i 'm happy with my toy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"in a word , `` awesome `` is how i would describe this camera .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i wo n 't go into the details here , as the online sites ( steve 's digicams , previews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"with the automatic settings , i really have n 't taken a bad picture yet .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n 't want to bother with the settings .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"excellent range of metering options as well .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the camera has a wonderful set of features .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this camera has canon 's great calorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the prints are beautiful ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is a great camera for you ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an `` auto `` mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the more i work with it , the more i love it ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in `` auto `` mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"four megapixels is great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i highly recommend it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"takes excellent photos .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"night mode is clear as day .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall it is the best camera on the market .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i love this camera .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"took hundreds of pictures and they were great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"great colors , pictures and white balance .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n 't moving , the photos were awesome .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the camera was a marvel .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the met 60 ct-4 .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1\/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k . reeves .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the service from the supplier was exceptional .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the camera is a dream to operate in auto mode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"2 . battery life is over 4 . 5 hours , compared to about 2 . 5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikon 's .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"and so far , i 've been very pleased .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"i 've taken about hundred shot with the canon , in varying lighting situations , all in auto mode , and not one blurry picture ! . ! . ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"sharper pictures .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the canon is very small , definitely pocket size , but still easy to hold firmly .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it powers up quickly , so you won 't miss that quick shot .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"good image quality .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"camera is a paper weight .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have been very impressed with my purchase of the sd500 i bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the pictures are tack sharp , colors are vivid , and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"powerup is quick , and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode , while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera , its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe ( max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the battery life is not that of the casio 's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opinion with the battery life you 've got .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"glad to see the ed . revised the previous statements regarding image quality .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"great picture quality - in automatic mode , quality is great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one ( canon a60 ( ? . ) . . . the 2 . 0 megapixel one ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips , i give it 5\/5 stars = ) oh and btw , while you take video clips , you can zoom it too ! . ( digital zoom only though ) . . . but still . . . ( my old one can 't do that . . . you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip . )","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"photo stitch ( merge pictures to create a panoramic one . . even my old one can do this and it 's really cool to have it now still )","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"if you 'll only read the whole manual , you 'll find out even more cool features and you 'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's such a great camera ! . i think it really was worth the investment = )","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don 't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i bought this camera two days ago , and i 'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"all in all , this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"having the digic ii chip helps a lot .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i still can 't believe how fast it starts up .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i still have my s70 because i like the wider lens sometimes , but in general , if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package , the sd500 is the only one you should buy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i tell you now , after lot of shooting in many different situations , this camera is amazing .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"i like to take pictures when i go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso 's but i don 't really care that much , i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact , take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've only had this camera for a few days , but it 's been great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the photo quality is amazing .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's fast , feels great in your hand and looks great too .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"as any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had simone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image appeared on the decently sized screen .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $ 500 price tag and get a quality camera .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"moreover , apart from the plastic cable cover , the camera has a nice , solid feel about it , and it 's so tiny , i take it with me wherever i go .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"as it turns out , this is an awesome camera ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"however , this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the sd500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"this is overall the best point and shoot camera i 've used .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i also tend to like the sliding cover\/on switch found on many compact ps cameras since it 's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"when the overall image quality ( especially natural colours , details , natural looking of the pictures ) is the most important thing , then this camera its top notch and very impressive .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"in low light with flash i found it clear better then the sony p200 ( too much red , colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i found best results in most situation with manual\/center auto focus , manual mode , iso 100 ( shorter aperture-time , so more often sharper images as with iso 50 ) , auto white balance ( auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras i have and they already do very-well ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"and it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old s30 .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 'm in high school , and this camera is perfect for what i use it for , carrying it around in my pocket so i can take pictures whenever i want to , of my friends and of funny things that happen .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"there is also a small covering for the lens , so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the picture quality surprised me , when i first saw this camera i saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good -- but i was wrong ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the focus is great , though , if you are not taking a macro shot .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera , but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace , i decided on the s100 .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it has given me zero problems , and the more i use it , the better i become at taking advantage of its strengths .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer ( with photo quality paper ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"i don 't believe this camera is still available . but if you can find one , you might like to get it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's still one of the smallest 2mp digital cameras on the market , and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i am very pleased with my purchase .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've been incredibly happy with this camera .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this camera is great if you 're used to a high-end slr .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's overkill for simple snapshots , unless you 've got way too much money to blow .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"exposure compensation in 1\/3 stop increments ( i leave it set on +1\/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure , which goes a bit dark for my taste ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"slow-syncro flash , macro\/infinity mode , etc .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the ss body is wonderful , feels high-quality .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"the panorama setting is unbelievable ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"you have the option to have the flash automatic or off .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing -- great battery saver .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"a great camera , but here are some points which i don 't notice in most of the reviews here , which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer :","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i purchased the elph s100 mainly because i thought it was cool .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"but i was ready to upgrade and when i discovered that canon was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher resolution , i had to have the s100 .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this camera is so light and tiny that i literally carry it everywhere with me , which is great considering i 'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"if compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera , the canon powershot s100 digital elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the s100 's image quality rates in the middle of its class , but it can still be a reasonable choice for students , families , or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i purchased this camera before it went on sale , and while i wouldn 't have minded keeping the extra $ $ $ , it was definitely worth it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"i just went on a quick photo shoot in nyc 's central park today , and what a bunch of beautiful photos i took , if i do say so myself ( and i do ! . )","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot , and with instant review on the lcd screen , you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i also had no problems installing or running the camera software on my pc .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"i was looking for a compact , rugged ( i carry it hiking , skiing , boating , etc ) camera which is easy to use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i wanted standard memory expansion ( cf cards ) , macro mode , and if possible , a waterproof housing ( for kayaking ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don 't need to fuss with a lens cap .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the macro mode works well , although it takes some practice since the camera doesn 't clearly indicate when it can 't focus .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the white-led backlit lcd is very bright and crisp , even in sunlight , and relatively easy on the battery .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the panorama modes are wonderful .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's so small and light , even with a spare battery , you really can take it anywhere .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"in auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance ( but there is no manual focus or manual exposure ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"there are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"1- small .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"very small .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've had a lot of cameras , but this one is actually being used , and not stored in a desk : it 's all ways in my shiest pocket .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"2- excellent picture quality and so simple to use ! . ! . ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"4- looks great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"6- small but very clear tft screen .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"don 't care about sunlight : it 's tft .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this camera is great , wonderfully small , and has attractive hi-tech casing .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"very easy to use for someone like me who 's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"so , why the small digital elph , rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality ? . size [ +2 ]","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"after getting one for christmas from amazon , i 'm now a believer : the digital elph is truly the world 's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the size is tiny , which i love .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this camera is so easy to use ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"all the features are incredibly intuitive , even for a novice like me .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the pictures are beautiful , and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i , as many others , have waited for many years for the convergence of price , features , size and ease of use to hit that happy center point .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i bought this little guy a few weeks back , and i have to say that i never had so much fun with a new toy as this .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"you indefinitely appreciate the small size .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the software is great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"transfering is easy , the software makes everything pretty easy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"get it , it 's woth every penny ! . ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've had it for a week now , do n 't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"software is easy to use ( although red hat software is better , but costs money )","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n 't get damaged \/ scratched fast transfer rate","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well re cored mp3s .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"so far the software for the pc works easily .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"by the way , it looks nice also .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's worth it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"other plusses : changeable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"( batteries last longer too ! . )","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n 't blind you when you stare too long .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i had no problems following their installation instructions .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the menus are very easy to navigate .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the other controls are all very easy to use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it also costs a lot less than the ipod .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the earbuds that come with it are n 't that bad .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have n 't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"other than that this thing is great . . .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i love my new nomad , its great ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"another plus in my book , no file limits ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i really have no complaints over this unit .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have no complaints with this mp3 player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"then sorting the files is easy as pie .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and it holds so much music and audio files .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the battery is nice .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the lcd screen was very large and readable .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i love this player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the software was great , as long as you have an administrative user account ( windows xp ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"way less expensive than the ipod .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i find it pretty easy to use . . . and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) . . .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1 . 1 usb ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the setup and transfer process was cake for me .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"ripping your songs and creating playlists could n 't be any easier .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukebox ed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"- best in class sound","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"- large easy readable screen","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"working for 10 hours with it on `` shuffle `` totally rocks ! . ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i love it ! . ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2 . 0 .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i love the storage in this thing .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this thing seriously is a good player though .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall i like the unit .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"1 ) price \/ gb of storage","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"2 ) storage capacity","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"3 ) user replaceable battery","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall i like it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the storage capacity is great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the price compared to the ipod is great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've had no problems with the software .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i found it intuitive to use ( i did n 't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is a nice feature ( i . e . it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to `` easy listening `` rather than `` heavy metal `` - no problem .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the sound from the player is ok .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my counter top and also to listen to my old 8-track records .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"for the price and features it is really good .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n 't wash my car .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a hard drive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"otherwise , this player is awesome ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recommend www . no madness . net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"compared to other leading dd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"- uploading music is quick and easy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n 't .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"- equipment included is average , but that is n 't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; . a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibels , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the software has n 't been a hassle for me at all .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"lastly , the price is fantastic :","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"usb 2 . 0 - very fast","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and for those that are int rested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i am very pleased so far .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"very simple to use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"all in all suprisingly easy to use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the battery life seems good , takes very little time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i would recommend this product to anyone .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n 't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n 't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n 't take up space on your pc hard drive .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the software could n 't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n 't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it is an extremely cool cozmo .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it has n't gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's easy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"sound quality is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"also , you can store data on it , which is a plus . for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n 't bother , this is a much better buy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good . . .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the storage capacity is great for me --","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"second , the `` automatic `` sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it also lets you remove songs from the play order .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this did n 't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"extremely convenient .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"great price .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i thought the software was decent enough - it was n 't complicated to learn at all .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 'm really happy with this purchase .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"now he res the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equalizer type deals on here .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything . . . good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"* price and capacity","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"* slick-looking design and improved interface","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"* removable battery","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; . this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57 , 000 mb of free memory available to me .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 . 0 .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"ripping the songs , even with my 1 . 1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n 't be easier to use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and with usb 2 . 0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"1 . i achieved my basic objective ; . my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; . when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; . if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n 't even notice the click .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"+ \/ - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweaking with settings to try to make it great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the price \/ performance looked just right .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's `` unspecified `` ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"4 ) usb 2 . 0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song \/ sec ! . ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"b . fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2 . 4 hz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"c . i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www . ipod 's dirty secret . com .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n 't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"fact is , it could n 't be easier to use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"usb 2 . 0 transfer is insanely fast .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall , a good buy for the price .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumb wheel scroll \/ push button .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i bought the player this week and i like it by far .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"value : comparing data storage with price .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the appearance is okay ed ( at least not ugly ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on your sound quality , the sound might crack .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of `` now playing `` interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and also , it 's priced very afford ably .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"with 40gb of storage i have about 7 , 500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2 , 500 more .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's `` notmad `` software because of some advanced features i wanted .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n 't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him \/ herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , rivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"price ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song \/ playlist etc fast enough .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n 't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the screen 's large and easily read .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"honestly , i love this player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"works great , no odor , and uses regular bags .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"so far ( 3 weeks ) , we 've had no problems with the diaper champ at all .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i don 't know if we 'll run into trouble down the road with odors , but so far i have no complaints and i 'm very happy not to have to buy those refills .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the diaper champ is the best we found ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"there are no spec ail bags to deal with or buy ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"we use the cheap $ 1 . 99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and it 's fairly inexpensive as baby products go ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i love that you don 't have to purchase expensive refills .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"if i had to do it over again , even with the cost savings of using any type of bag , i would go w\/ the diaper genie .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's far better than all others on the market .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"1 . it uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"3 . it never smelled - at all .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the container is hard to open , which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler , and you do have to flip the handle carefully ( which has saved more than a few of her toys , too . ) i don 't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is a must have product for all new moms ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it also holds a lot more diapers .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"look at the size of it ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i highly recommend this ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have to say that i am very happy with it so far .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the bags attach inside the champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the diaper champ couldn 't be easier to use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and the biggest plus is that you don 't have to buy any expensive refills .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained , which the diaper genie never did ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"if you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained , than the diaper champ is the one for you ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this item is exceptional i like the ease of use and it held the odor in great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"diaper champ is by far the best diaper pail ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's easy to use ( just a flip of the lid , and the diaper is gone ! . ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's also easy to empty out .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers , this is the truly the only diaper pail to get ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"even though i never ventured into the cloth land , i was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"but from my experience , by the time it gets to that point , the bag is really heavy , so i think this is kind of helpful- it 's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is a really great buy , for yourself or as a shower gift .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"go for the champ .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i love this product ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"with the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn , it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and we still love it ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"*holds a lot of diapers -- a full week of toddler diapers ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"( we wrap them nice and tight ) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags -- cheap ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"we keep the diaper champ in our daughter 's nursery and her room definitely does not smell like dirty diapers .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it holds quite a few diapers , and pops them in quickly and easily .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it -- no special `` diaper `` trash bags necessary .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it works with a minimum of fuss .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into `` what diaper smell `` in less time than that .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is one of the best purchases we made .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"great product , easy to use , economical , effective , absolutly fabulous .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"update i knew that i loved the champ , and using the diaper genie at a friend 's house really reinforced that ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"there is no comparison , the champ is easy and smell free , the genie was difficult to use one handed ( which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad ) and there was a def finite odor emanating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn 't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i love this pail ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"no smell , easy to use with one hand free , and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don 't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are impossible to find ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i think it 's great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it definitely keeps the smell out .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"first 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the diaper champ is the best ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have tried other pails , but none have compared positively to the champ .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"1 ) the champ is easy to use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"2 ) the champ uses regular store bags .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"you do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the champ .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"regardless to this fact , i believe the champ is the best way to go .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"no need for deodorizers .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"even did while daughter sleep and no noise ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i use the scented bags and even if i don 't no smell ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this holds alot and does not take up alot of space .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"but like i stated , its better then a trash can , but i 'm not sure if its better then the diaper genie .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"personally , i am very pleased with the diaper champ .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it doesn 't stink , ever ( like some have assumed since it doesn 't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and it is very easy to clean .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time , it is that simple .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is a great diaper pail .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"there is no odor and it is very easy to use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"( you can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby . ) also , we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills ( like with the diaper genie ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and it 's the largest diaper pail i 've seen without taking up more floor space .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and we definitely prefer our champ ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because i change him so often downstairs .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"we have been using our diaper champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all ( and we live in the damp and humid south , where odors of all kinds are generally rife ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags , easy to clean , and most important , easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"we have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck ( we always wrap them in the dirty diaper ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"update ( march 2005 ) : my son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now , but the diaper champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use , no problems with odors , and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby : - )","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i decided to go with the diaper champ rather than the more popular diaper genie , because i didn 't like the idea of having to buy special bags .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this product is a lifesaver ! . ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"in fact , people who have been present while i changed my almost 3 month old son 's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent ' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once i dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"simple and it works ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"all in all , this product is definitely one i would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i love the diaper champ , it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn 't cost an arm and a leg for refills .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the height is a more convenient reach than others , where you have to hunch over .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"its stable , so a curious toddler can 't easily tip it over .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i wanted this product because i didn 't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is a great product ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the champ works great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"we use regular kitchen sized garbage bags .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"we 've never experienced odor from the pail .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it was easy to assemble , and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i also love that you can flip the device with one hand . . .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"excellent diaper disposal unit .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"a wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose ! . ! . ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"diaper champ is great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"so i can 't tell you if diaper champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell , but it 's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"friends told me that the diaper genie did not work very well , so bought the diaper champ based on on-line reviews and i have been happy with it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it works easily with one hand , which is important .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"also , it takes any kitchen sized trash bag , so there is no special bag to stock .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"while the perfect odor free diaper pail has yet to be invented , the diaper champ is a good as it gets .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i was using the cheaper pail . . . and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this one is really great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i actually took a friends word on it and went with this champ when registering and i am glad i did .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"well the champ has survived it 's first year with our son and it is great ! . ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"we just recently had to buy another roll of bags . so $ 6 . 00 for a year of bags- can 't beat that ! . ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"we lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is really a nice diaper pail .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"in fact , i liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old , that i bought one for our new baby 's room .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"wow - was that disappointing and we didn 't even have it 6 months before it broke .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"1 . the diaper champ doesn 't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"we just use the glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from target and they work wonderfully .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"we don 't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"2 . it can be operated with one hand - leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"so much safer than the others that require a two handed operation ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the diaper champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"3 . bags are easy to change .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"works great ! . ! . ! . ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"5 . the price is right .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the ct people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"from the internet , woodworking books , local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m12v 3-1\/4 hp router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the hitachi has plenty of power , runs smooth , and cuts effortlessly through maple ( with freud bits ! . )","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"since i use it in a table , i don 't use the plunge feature , but if i ever need it i 've got it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"so for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models i 've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & i like that .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"hitachi 's m12v is a big beast of a router .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"in my table the m12v has been a real champ .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"nice things about the m12v : - in a table , the powerful 3 1\/4 hp motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - amazon 's price","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is truly a clydesdale among the industry 3hp+ router workhorses .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"built like a tank , yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the edge guide is top quality , easy to install and accurate .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is a great deal , and i 'm elated with my decision to go with hitachi 's green machine .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"wish i could give it 4 1\/2 stars .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the speed control is well designed and it works perfectly .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it is heavy enough to make it stable , but not too heavy to preclude hand use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall this tool is very well worth the price and i have no regrets about my purchase .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i don 't have problems with the depth adjustment , the speed control , the collet ( i haven 't tried the 1\/4 `` sleeve yet ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i would put the hitachi up with the best ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"no vibration ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"smooth plunging ! . ( it did stick a bit so i sprayed it w\/ lubricant .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth precisely .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1\/4 hp models .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the soft start is nice .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the price is incredible with the bonus pack and hitachi 's $ 25 incentive ( you need the code -- -go to tool seeker . com and it tells you )","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the total price with delivery ( free shipping ) was $ 135 ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"unlike other reviewers , i like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some porter cable models i tried .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"for me , it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"can recommend the hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on amazon it is a bargain .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"after getting used to the m12 all the rest seemed lacking .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"on top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable , it is just a plunge router that works really well .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i use it in the table ( never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob ) , in my woo drat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"what an upgrade ! . ! . ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have only used it with the 1\/4 `` collet and a 1\/2 `` round over bit , but i love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the m12v than it was on my old router .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the handles make it very comfortable to use and i experience little vibration .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"combine this with the excellent price we got in the gold box , and i 'm really happy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 'm sure i don 't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers , but i really like it ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i find it very stable and comfortable to use , it doesn 't jump around or make me feel like i need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control , and it has very good visibility to see your cut .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it came with a good fence that is simple yet precise and thats well made and won 't break .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"also i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn 't have any extra knobs or gizmo 's .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i prefer things that are simple .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut , and the speed control knob is easy to get to .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"its not a perfect system but its a very good one .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it is quiet and has plenty of power .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i love the performance and features of this router .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"smooth plunging mechanism .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"even with that , i highly recommend this router - outstanding performer .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i purchased two of these beauties .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before i drop money on a tool and everyone i talked to loved this router .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"one cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the design of the col lets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craft man ( toy\/junk ) routers i have previously purchased .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"they were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything i have encountered .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than i would have if i had purchased a single cheap reliant sharper .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the setup works awesome , as with any tool i look closely at the individual tool for it 's merits , and not just the company as a whole .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i would however highly recommend the m12v router ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 'm not overly fond of green but when i used this hitachi m12v it turns out that now i 'm very fond of it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the smooth operation variable speed and a set of good masada bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"its well made and user friendly .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"you 'll love it ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this router has soft start and runs smooth and true .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass , but i usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"you just can 't go wrong with this one ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"enjoy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is a well-made and powerful tool .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the m12v has been great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the height adjustment works well- not perfect .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i did like the heft of the machine .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the power is incredible , it cut through md and plywood like butter .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i do not count this as a negative , however , because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up ! . ! . ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the ones i 've kept ( porter cables , dew alts , bosch , and this hitachi ) have proven their worth over the years , however , when i need a real workhorse , i grab this router .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i recently had to run a 3\/4 `` straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn 't even slow down .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i could take 1\/2 `` passes and it still didn 't skip a beat .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've yet to find the limitation for this hitachi ( my only hitachi tool , by the way ) and quite frankly , i don 't know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"bottom line is that at $ 160 , this is an absolute steal .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've got a buddy who 's trying to offload his almost new $ 300 systematic because he saw what this router can do .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it is without even a slight doubt , my new favorite .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the hitachi m12v is a dream to work with , smooth starts , adjustable speeds , micro-adjustable depth , and plenty of power to spare .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i couldn 't believe what i had been missing .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"if you 're looking for a 3hp plunge router , the hitachi m12v is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 'll be getting a second one for my router table ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have been impressed with the power of the hitachi m12v .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i use it on a router table , and it is works well .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"other than this , i am very pleased with the router and would buy it again .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i like the speed control .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it has plenty of power .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"all in all i am pleased with the router .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the power , low noise operation , and speed control makes up for the problems i have experienced .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"for the price i don 't think you can beat it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is a fantastic tool to use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is a quality product , not to be confused with the cheap junk that hitachi gets manufactured in china .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"but , for the money it is a good machine .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"for the hobbiest , it 's probably a nice buy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"for the person that uses the equipment every day , pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this router does everything that it is supposed to do , so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it , just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it works great , i am usually at the full 54 mbps , although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it really is a great buy if you are loo kin at having just one modem but many computers around the house .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"there are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router , and everybody is happy with it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"its the easiest thing to setup i thought , and i am only 16 . . . so with all that said , buy the router ! . ! . ! . ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i recently bought the linksys wrt54g router and have been very happy with the router itself .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"but the product is elf is great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"once you set it up , it 's great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and it is extremely well-priced for what you 're getting .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"another 5 star performance .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this setup using the cd was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"pertaining to the speed issue : i got 54mps while i was in the same room .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this router works at 54mbps that 's megabyte not kilobyte .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i hooked the linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus kilobytes on the download e ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"installation was as near automatic as can be .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"all in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"all you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"awesome for the newbie , though i personally like to fasten every bolt myself .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"comes with a installation cd which instructs you step by step to setting up the router .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"you need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the router works fine for both wired and wireless .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall , if you know what basic steps to take , it was not difficult to connect , and the s\/w worked well to connect .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"just want a wireless router for home or your very small business , you can just get a wrt54g from here and configure it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something , but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router , just get the wrt54g .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 'll make life a lot easier , and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is my fourth linksys product and , aside from the rough start , i 'm very satisfied with this router .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this linksys router does it for the right price .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn 't called me yet with any problems .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"there are instructions to encrypt your personal wireless network so no one else can end up hogging\/stealing your bandwidth .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and the tech writers have made the installation process so easy for people lick my aunt to follow .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"a very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i upgraded from an older 801 . 11b router to the linksys wrt54g for its improved security , and of course , speed .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"as i mentioned in my first paragraph , it supports wpa security , which is far superior to wep .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"anted to rate the router higher than 1 star , due to its security , easy of use , etc .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"so far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the setup was very easy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"just follow the instructions carefully , it 's all based on a cd that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"drops and strong signals even from the backyard .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the wrt54g offers excellent security features and much more ( and easier ) configuration menu that i didn 't even need a manual to setup correctly .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the quality is significant and you 'll be very happy from saving time and the headache .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it is a nice router in all ways but one .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"however , setting up using the quick start instructions was a breeze .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's easy to install the security on this product but linksys doesn 't do a good job of explaining why its important .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"while i am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time , my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than linksys .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"unlike other reviewers , i have found the support to be responsive , almost no wait time on the phone , and relatively knowledgeable .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall , this router seems like a reasonably priced product th ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's easy and really works , with some incredible range .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"compatibility with other devices is excellent too ; . i 've only found one 11b device that won 't work with its mixed mode ( and it won 't work with *anyone 's* mixed mode ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"setup in xp was instant and intuitive .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"my experience with installation was quite good .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my sony vaio laptop ( xp operating system ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i haven 't tried to set up any advanced features on the router , but it is not difficult to set up for basic use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- i needed a lot of help from linksys technical assistance to set that one up .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i like this router a whole lot better the linksys 11b router it replaced -- the signal strength seems ot be much strainers , seldom falling below the `` very good `` range ( and most often excellent within 25-50 feet of the router .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the transmission speed is also quite good , with pages loading very quickly .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have had no problem either with backward compatibility , in that the `` mixed mode `` feature lets you both 54 and 11 mb cards off the router .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"as far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the g standard was introduced to the market .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"all in all , it 's a good router if you don 't have the cash for a speed booster one .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i just replaced my old linksys router with this one , turned everything on in the right order , and it was up and running with no problems .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"yin to point out they have experience , and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this model appears to be especially good .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the darn thing works as promised and it 's amazingly cheap too .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"if you want to work wirelessly , this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"to set up the box , wap , and ether nest bridge , with the encryption on was less then 30 mins .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the setup software did everything .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i am getting better speeds on all my web programs .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"pros . 1 . speed 2 . signal strength 3 . advanced configuration options","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"works perfectly with my netgear wireless paramecia .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"feature wise , its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"however since this router is backward compatible , that doesn 't pose a problem at all .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall , it 'll make my move that much easier knowing i don 't have to worry about connectivity .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"for more than a year , and it is totally reliable .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"no down time , great signal strength .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"there is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"setup is totally breeze and linksys 's web site is pretty easy to navigate .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the fact that has an open-source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"a call to customer support ( got to a live person within a couple of minutes ) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"speed is not a problem .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"second , the setup cd actually worked perfectly .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i still need to read up on some of the security settings , etc to fully understand all that 's up there , but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the speed boost router .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"when i saw a high gain ( low price ) antenna was available to the wrt54g router , i thought i 'd happily give up some ( practically unattainable anyway , since you 've got to be in spitting distance from the router ) speed in favor of wider coverage .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"having done all this , i was quite pleased to see that all corners i needed were decently covered by the signal .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the box is upstairs , and in the farthest room i get connected at 11-18m speed - that is similar to the older 10m ethernet standard .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"apart from speed , the signal is consistent and works without interruptions , etc .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"all of this said [ as it 's on it 's way back to amazon ] , the one song it did include provided far better sound than the ipod .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the base was deeper and the highs were crisper .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"what a kick butt mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source , instead of paying for them two or three times , then get the creative zen ipod killer , kiss my ass itunes ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the sound is great , the portability , etc . . . all the `` stuff `` you expect from a good mp-3 player , this zen micro has it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature . .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the zen micro fm receiver is ok , not great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"smaller size , 1 gb of more space , radio , voice recording , removable battery , cooler look , all in one .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"also if you want a device that does so much more than the ipod mini but is at the same price , this is the player for you .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"upon opening the box i was confronted with this small cute little mp3 player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"the package also comes with a usb cable , an ac adapter , a pair of headphones ( they 're okay until you get a better pair ) , a stand , and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's cute as anything and the glowing blue led looks super cool around the edges .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"for the price i think this is a remarkably fun mp3 player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've had this player for more than 4 months and i 'm very happy with it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"1 speakers at home , i rarely use it with the earbuds , though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the look & feel : i have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambiance .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it feels tiny in the hand without it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the blue backlit lcd looks really neat and is easy to read .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon 't slip which was very thoughtful .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"reliability & build i dropped the player once from about 4 ft , and it fell hard , but kept on playing .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the hard case they give with it must work well .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"sound i 'm no audiophile but i was amazed by the clarity the player had , it was much better than the sound card on my computer and louder too .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"best of all the wmas ( i have a lot of them ) sound great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"utility its got a huge list of features including an fm recorder a calender and contacts list .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the songs recorded with fm are as good as the original signal .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges , i had a new zen .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the sound is quite good , in terms of volume .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"all-in-all , its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"you can use it as a storage hard drive .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"also , the wma compression format is superior to mp3 , especially at lower bit rates , so i needed a player that could handle wma and integrate well with my windows xp computers .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories ( desk stand\/hard case , belt clip , wall charger , etc ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and so far , i have been very , very happy with my zen micro .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"- replaceable battery .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have not yet used all the features , like the calendar , etc , but as a music player this little thing rocks .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"if you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty , this is the player to get ! . highly recommended .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the micro seemed like an ipod for less .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"pros : - excellent sound , even with the headphones that come out of the box , but it absolutely rocked with my bose quiet comfort 2 set .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"don 't worry this player rocks .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"a distinct ipod relation is evident with white colored cables , power plug and the very nice zen case with a white rubber inside covering .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i do give create to creative for their attractive design .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it makes the nomad i purchase feel and look like junk .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"everything shines of quality .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i was more excited about this player upon opening than i was about the nomad .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i am now staring at an array of stuff including zen micro player , stereo earbud headphones , a rechargeable lithium-ion battery , an ac\/dc power adapter , a usb 2 . 0 cable , a belt-clip , a stand , a stylish cloth pouch , an installation cd , a quick-start guide , and creative mediasource software .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the interface works great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i enjoy getting use to the touch pad .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"in minutes i was easily navigating through the menus .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"what impressed me most was the sound .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"at 128 the songs sound very good .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the zen lives up to the audio quality i love and expect .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the earbuds are great headphones as good as my ak studio 240 , well not as good but darn close .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the zen was an impressive purchase and i would highly recommend it to anyone using napster .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's so small .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"it 's faster than wmp .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"so far i have no complaints with this player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"if anyone is thinking of getting an ipod mini , forget it and go with this player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's cheaper , holds more songs and is smaller .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have stored 40 audio cds and i still have close to 2 . 8 gb free .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"user interface : the software is simple and straight forward .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"you can use the player to store your computer data files ( good feature to have ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"battery : a big big plus .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"most of the other players i checked dont have user serviceable battery .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"each battery lasts about 10-11 hours .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"fm tuner & microphone : having a tuner in the player is a blessing .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"built in microphone is great for recording short voice notes .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"sound : this is where i love zen the most .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"excellent sound i mean the player has juice .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the bass treble the sound detail is aw some .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i compared it to other cd players ( two models of panasonic , rio & samsung ) and they were no way even near zen micro .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"looks and shape : i have a black one and the first time i charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"fits well in hand in trouser pockets .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"freebies you get : a cradle with detachable stand and belt clip , some thing very handy and useful .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"fm transmitter ( belkin has a good one ) to use zen with your car stereo fm tuner latest find : connected this baby to my $ 3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to ipod .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"thankfully , creative has come through with a product that puts the ipod back in its place .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"while i have not had the `` privilege `` , as many call it , of owning an ipod , based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their ipod ( and subsequently purchased the zen touch or zen micro ) , i can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the zen micro was one of the more informed ones .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"by focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing , they have introduced a player that can look the ipod straight in the eye and not flinch .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"while i 'm not too keen on their customer service ( none of the products i have from creative have given me issues ) , i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more . . . without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"about the product : the zen micro is a sleek , stylish device that caters not just to `` hip `` youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life , size , or the `` awkward `` factor .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"battery life is exceptional , lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"also , i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software , which i had with audigy zs sound card originally ; . it is definitely an added plus .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"all-in-all , creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features , and i look forward to the nomad\/zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"initially , i was very impressed , after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this , i then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the extra gb of hard rive space , remove able battery and fm tuner , as well as the fact that i was previously a satisfied owner of the nomad ii put it over the top for me .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"fortunately for me , i have yet to have a single problem with this player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"however , there is a more detailed pdf manual on the cd ( and online ) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the zen micro .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"as opposed to the nomad ii or any other flash based player , the songs load extremely fast . . . about one or two seconds per song .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"after comparing the included creative earbuds directly against my sony md-e828lp 's and sennheiser mx-400 's , i find myself still using the creative 's , which in my opinion , sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"perhaps i bought the micro to be different , the cheaper price tag ( from amazon ) , the design , or avoiding the high ipod theft in nyc subways .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"whichever it may be , i 'm happy i 've made this purchase .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"when i opened the box , i was shocked by the size of this thing . . . it 's tiny ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's shorter , sleeker , more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the ipod . . . my nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"moving on to sound department . . . it delivers ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"there are extra features packed inside this unit ( some that most will hardly ever use ) such as fm radio tuner , voice recorder , calendar , and alarm clock .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"speaking of battery , it 's removable and replaceable ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall , the micro is a solid device and i haven 't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood* .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"transferring music is a breeze . i don 't subscribe to music services , but as mentioned on other reviews , micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it may not top the ipod mini , but it 's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"strong points : - design : small , comfortable , curved , and stylish .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"you don 't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a `` special edition `` to get black ! . - sound : awesome ! . - batteries : removable\/replaceable .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"- audio formats : supports both mp3 , wma . . . and yeah , wav too .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this product is amazing and better than the ipod you can get at the same price .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the 4g ipod costs the same as this 5g zen micro .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"creative did an awesome job with the design .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it ( a stand , a belt hook , charger ) that i know doesn 't come with every one .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have the black one and adore it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the ipod mini .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall , i 've been very impressed with the player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've had almost no problems with the firmware ( ie , lock-ups , shut-downs etc ) , but i have kept the player up to date .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its li-ion battery , the better firmware , or a combination of both factors .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i imagine if i left my player untouched ( no backlight ) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"one of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to windows media player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"its just as fast as the included creative software , but much less invasive , and overall better looking .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the touchpad is great once you get used to it , and i much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels ( as on the dell dj for example ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"they are sensitive and accurate ( perhaps too accurate , it senses through t-shirt cloth , but the touchpad can be locked ) , but easy to clean , unlike buttons .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the player looks great , feels great , and sounds great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"so far it has been very durable ( other than the little pads on the earbuds ) , but those aren 't really necessary as i find them comfortable on their own .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"they also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like panasonic 's and sennheisers .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces , and it still works flawlessly .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this year , it seems that i choose my timing perfectly , having discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the computer interface is 90 % good , only losing points due to the fact that `` creative `` branding is all over the place within it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"on the fly play list creation , address book , removable storage drive capabilities , sound recorder , the list goes on people , this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies , it was like halloween all over again .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"so far i have used all of the above-mentioned features , and find them well designed , and easy to understand .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"that 's it for now , what are you doing still reading this , click the `` add to cart `` button already ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"right out of the box , i loved it , better features than the ipod , great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources i can use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"original review december 2004 i 'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their zen micro , but mine has worked great ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is my first mp3 player and i am so impressed with what such a small device can do .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have ripped over 100 songs from my cd collection and it was so easy and fast , and they all sound great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i love that you can create custom playlists , and organize music in so many different ways .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall , i am very pleased with it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"before you run out and buy an ipod , understand something : there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle , principally excellent ( for mp3 ) sound quality .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre ipod buds .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"bottom line : if you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services , and are willing to deal with the possibility ( not the certainty ) of setup gremlins , by all means get the zen micro .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the zen micro is near perfect .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's still alive , still kicking , and still playing .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the zen micro ( mine 's black ) has a lot going for it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it fits into a hand well , it has a removable battery ( this is important ) , great sound quality , fm stereo , recorder , smooth ui , and a feature that most uni pods lack . . . char ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the accessories that come with the player are great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"white earbuds ( i replaced those with some shire headphones , big difference ) , a case , a stand , a clip ( which doesn 't really work ) , and a nice little zen micro bag .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"pick your favorite color and buy it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"pros the design is very nice , and the colors are too .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it also has tons more features then previous creative products , and most of them are very useful such as the ability to customize the main menu to show the stuff you want , not the default items ( creative labs . com for more on that ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"if you don 't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive , i 'd re comment buying it to try out , and also buy an extra 2 year warranty for it ( there are some offered here , for about $ 15 dollars i think ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hard shell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +usb cable ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"+battery life is awesome if you upgrade the firmware [ requires a windows pc ] or make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +awesome sound quality . . . i mean it is creative right ? .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"+sorts music by artist , album , genre , etc . . . it 's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you 're looking for .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"but since it 's so small , it isn 't a big deal to bring it with me .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall though , i 'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player , even if it is to pretend your not a brain dead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod . ; . )","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with napster 2 go . . . . which is a subscription service , allowing me to download as much music as i want for a $ 14 . 95 flat fee .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and i must say . . . this mp3 is very cool .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's so cute . . . and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"after installation , which was very simple . . . . i downloaded any updated software from the creative website , before i downloaded any music .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the sound is very nice .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i also like the lock feature , so it makes the touch pad inactive .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"otherwise , i am extremely please with the creative zen micro 5gb mp3 player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"however after playing with it for three weeks now , i 'm convinced , the zen micro is superior .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature , and the zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality , with no need to upgrade the earphones .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i thought the fm radio would not see much use with so many tracks available to me , but its great for tuning in to tv programs at the gym while on the treadmill , concerts and programs being simulcast , npr , and on and on .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"its also smaller , and gets more looks .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i purchased this over the ipod mini because it had several nice features : extra 1g storage , wma support , replaceable battery , and especially that it wasn 't an apple product with their proprietary architecture .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"creative has excellent music software , a very responsive tech support group ( they are quick on firmware updates , and make them publicly available ) , and usually a good array of accessories .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the zen micro is no exception : in addition to the case , it comes with a neck strap , and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the extra spare battery is just a neat bonus .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"if i could , i 'd trade-up on my creative muvo2 and snag a zen micro tomorrow .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the store 's sound system .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"feature for feature , i find it a very sweet little player ; . equipped with a higher end headphone system , between this and th larger zen hardly use my home stereo system anymore .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"on the whole , i 'm quite happy with the purchase .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the device looks very cool , i think ( exactly as the photos promise ) , it 's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket , and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"no offense to amazon , but i was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks ( i 'm sure prices here will continue to sink ) , and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i like some local stations , stern , and npr , and so the radio seemed like a great option .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"ball metaphor : i was hoping creative hit a home run here , and i think the zen micro is more like a stand-up double .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"actually , the creative zen micro solves all that .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"sound quality ? . phenomenal .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"unarguably better than apple 's , and nice earbuds to boot .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"no skips , and it hasn 't faltered once ( despite your inevitable drop or two .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"flawless .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the voice recorder is a beautiful add-on ; . not even necessary , but just an example of why apple just wants your money and creative labs wants to make a better player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"in conclusion , this player is beautiful .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"power for the tech-savvy , ease of use for the less fortunate .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this player is absolutely phenomenal , i haven 't had any problems , and if you 're worried you will have problems , i suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways . . . i find the touch pad very easy to use , and i 'm surprised so many people have had problems .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the radio works excellent in my area , i 'm not sure everywhere else .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the software is very easy to use , and the transfer is super fast ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 'm not gon na go into the features cause if you 're reading this review , you 've probably already looked at them , but i must say the dj feature if very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"t simply the best player on the market for a really low price , so why look anywhere else ? .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've had it for about a week now and have to say it 's one of the best purchases i 've ever made .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have no problems with the touch pad ( once the sensitivity is set to low ) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"why bother when it works perfectly with media player 10 ? .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the extra gb is just a bonus .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"if your looking for a great sounding mini player , you can 't go wrong with the zen micro .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it was a good player when it worked and i loved the design .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the creative zen micro , at first glance , is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the zen offered a great alternative .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's easy to use , and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the clarity is unbelievable , which means you can cram almost the full 2 , 5 ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"transfering mp3s are a cinch with the included software .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the zen plays mp3 , wma and wave formats , which makes it more versatile than the ipod .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"track # , name , artist , album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled , and properly categorized into the zen .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"ks almost without fail , no matter what your taste in music is : from relaxation music to hard rock , to hip hop , to korean and japanese , to afro-cuban and salsa , jazz , blues , country and pop , this feature performs well .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"oh , and another is the cool `` halo `` light that surrounds the touch pad , and light 's up when you touch the screen , and how the light glows when the zen is connected to the computer .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"one : it 's size : it 's smaller than the ipod mini , and holds more music ( 5gb to the ipod mini 's 4gbs ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"two : it has a removeable\/rechargeable battery , so you don 't have to send the thing in when the re ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this player is fantastic in terms of audio quality , ease of use , and features .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"otherwise , this is a great `` alternative `` mp3 player for those of use who don 't want to worship the mighty all-powerful apple .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i got it to use with the new $ 5-per-month service from yahoo ( music unlimited , ) and despite the above issues , i love it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it beats apple on the storage space , it beats apple on the removable battery ( and batter life ) , and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"further , the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the ipod .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"however , the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'zen micro ' has to offer .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"some features that the 'zen micro ' has that sold me on my purchase include : a 5g hard drive . . . actually an sd flash card drive . . . very large and much more than actually needed , the ability to sync with microsoft outlook 's calendar , the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours ( i can change the battery myself for about $ 40 to buy vs .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $ 90 ) , the ability to record with a built-in microphone ( great for recording reminders and meetings ) , very sturdy construction , and not to mention . . . the sound quality is excellent ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"as far as user interface is concerned , the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player , 'creative mediasource organizer ' .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"by far this seems to be the best value out there for the money ; . if you are undecided , the creative zen micro seems to be the best choice .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"when it 's working , it 's great but it is very temper mental .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie levitt 's , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n 't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ; .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful `` scene `` mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach \/ snow , sunset etc . , are endless .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the movie mode is also working great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"even at the `` normal `` setting , a 8x10 print ! . shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a `` digital `` .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"touch ups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargeable , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"great camera , great investment ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but on full size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is a wonderful camera .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon . never knew i could love a digital camera so much .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"the picture rs are amazing .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel \/ fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i particularly like the `` txt `` file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone i have owned .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this may be a really cool phone , but it 's not worth it with t-mobile .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"camera quality isn 't bad for the low resolution .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"i was looking for a phone which synced with mac osx using bluetooth , had decent battery life , could check email , had good reception , nice screen size and was durable ( i break often break small gadgets )","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the interface is simple to use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"the camera is adequate and if i want high-res photos i 'll use my digital camera instead .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"outside of the t-mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto at & t wireless and various other services where the t-mobile service was unavailable .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"as i drove across the country i lost reception only in eastern kentucky 's mountains .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"along the way we compared it to my wife 's t720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life , connectivity bars and features .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"but you can download some really good ones like pac-man or mafia wars .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall the phones fantastic , and i would have given it 5 stars , but its not perfect .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the battery on mine lasts 2 days if i don 't play games that much , and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"as for bluetooth , no problems at all .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've connected the phone with two laptops and a ipa 4155 .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"very simple and painless .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is the first cell phone i 've owned , and overall , i am quite pleased with it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"among my requirements for a phone were : good screen , decent camera , bluetooth , and gprs support .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"one primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that i could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux , where soft modem drivers are hard to find , and don 't work very well .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"if you are using linux , and you want to use gprs to connect to the net , i suggest this phone along with a belkin usb bluetooth adapter .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have really enjoyed the camera on this phone .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and the phone has a very cool feature which allows you to send images via a normal pop3\/smtp e-mail account .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward , although you do need an external smut server to use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the phone can use any midi audio file as a ringtone .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"you can use the ob ex file transfer service with bluetooth from linux ( kde-bluetooth provides a nice integration into conqueror for this ) for sending files to the phone .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the fact that you can assign ringtones to people and\/or groups is really cool .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"but if you use all bluetooth accessories , as i do , its really not an issue .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i recommend t-mobile and the nokia 6600 without reservation .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the nokia 660 runs the symbian os , which works pretty well for most standard phone fare , most of the stuff is not that intuitive , but if you actually learn how to use it all , there 's plenty of neat tie-ins .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images , calender events , contacts and anything else .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"this way i never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones , i can get whatever i want .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"other than that , the simian series 60 os is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you 're willing to hunt for it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone , web browser and of course the built in camera .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the good : 1 ) large lcd screen , colorful display , good resolution .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"2 ) nice features , like web browser , camera , video recorder , speaker phone ( very usefully ) , clear voice reception .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"many of these programs are shareware , some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it uses the extend able mmc memory , it is perfect for storing videos , pictures and mp3s .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"its nice look is also a plus .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and also , since it is teri band and since it uses sim-card , you can just use it in europe and many other parts of the world , wherever gsm exists .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i am just in love with this phone , especially after using a more primitive phone about 3 years .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at & # 38 ; . t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of `` plastic-like `` ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i . e . organizer ) , and the radio ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3 . 5 ) , but unfortunately , i am returning it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n 't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone `` unlike the nokia 3650 `` and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make . . .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}

{"text":"it is crystal clear .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"sound quality : the ipod 's sound quality is pretty good .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the bass is deep and the treble is clear .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from jobs and company .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"long live apple , long live macs , and long live the ipod ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have an ipod and it is a great buy .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"very sturdy and strong .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this new click wheel ipod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the song quality of the ipod is excellent , and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory , for most users .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"thank you apple ! . you make fabulous products .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the product i rate five stars ,","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"plus , if you order from amazon . com , they will exchange it for you no problem .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and , very importantly , the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the sound is just fine .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it comes with an adapter to plug into the wall , which i hear is a step up from the other ipods , which require you plug it into a computer to charge it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"pros : large hard drive for the $ $ -- 20gb and 40gb are both affordable .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"decently sized screen -- one of the larger ones on the market at 2 ``","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"decent battery -- on the average size , but the 40gb comes with a dock .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"firewire & usb2 . 0 -- for those fortunate enough to have firewire400 , your in for a real treat with auto sync .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"good sound -- plays very nicely , even though the stock headphones are kind of weak durable -- not the most durable because its mostly plastic , but very compact and sturdy","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"games -- not really important , but exist ant","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":". itunes -- this is a love-hate relationship program ; . usually people with mac like this program than people with a pc , but depending on your computer expertise , this could be a difficult program to use , and it is required for an ipod .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"comments : overall this is still a great value , but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"versatile and stylish .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i had a casio unit , which had given great service , and would have been happy to get another one , but was tempted by the ipod 's sleek design , storage capacity , connection options- - firewire and usb , and its integration with itunes .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the ipod is a very nice product , which given reasonable care , should give a lot of service .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i have about 6 gb used on my ipod so far ( well over 1000 songs ) , and as far as i can tell , all of them play at near-cd quality .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"other than the fact that one can 't delete a file directly from the ipod , the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"as for itunes , i don 't find it to be as good as the windows media player as a computer mp3 player , but it is good enough .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"in conclusion , i gave the ipod a 4\/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"everything i wanted ! . the apple ipod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"its sleek design , large memory capacity , compatibility with itunes , and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"features : click wheel to navigate ; . ability to work with windows or mac ; . optional back lighting ( you can have it on all the time , or have it shut off to save battery power after 5 , 10 , or 20 seconds ) ; . ability to download pda info ; . automatic or manual download from itunes when ipod is plugged into your computer .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"there 's even an equalizer ( under `` settings `` ) that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic , bass booster , bass reducer , classical , dance , `` deep `` , and electronic .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"with accessories , you can make the ipod into a digital recorder , broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology , and play it through your car speakers using either a cd adaptor or fm stereo broadcaster .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"itunes can be downloaded from the enclosed cd or for free from the apple site .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"all in all , this is a wonderful device .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"battery non-issue .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"finally , compare the ipod to other players on a cost\/gb , and also consider ease of use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the ipod is not overpriced compared to the market .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is the best purchase i 've made in a very long time .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the sound quality is excellent , accessing the music is easy , and the controls are generally well thought out .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the battery holds a charge for a very long time ( maybe 15 or so hours of use ) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with ipod use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"( it sure does look nice , though ! . ) i recommend this to any music lover anywhere : the quality of the audio is excellent , the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive , and the storage capacity and battery life are huge ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"and , with the ipods ' full volume up , all you have to do is adjust your receivers ' volume and your set , since the ipod itself acts as a strong amp lifer of its ' own .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"however after purchasing a 20 gb ipod it 's clear to see the superiority .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"for a sleeker , smaller and more `` average `` mp3 player the nitrus is great but the ipod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the actual experience of using the ipod is magnificent .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the design , as mentioned above , is sleek , cool and trendy ( and i think trendy = good , but it 's always hard to tell these days ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the battery life last es 12 hours , and charges quickly . ( as mentioned above , the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all ! . ) once you 've downloaded your music , you can access the tracks by artist , genre , album , composer ( this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e . g . covers of songs ) , etc .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the ! . sound quality is great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the included earphones are pretty good - my advice ? .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the ease of use of the ipod is a major attribute .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"with the ipod , you can also store documents and contact files ( from programs such as microsoft outlook ) when it 's connected to your pc as an external hard drive .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"also included in the `` games `` section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"20 gb or 40 gb ? . the pros of the 40 gb : comes with a `` dock station `` and double storage space ( 10 , 000 songs ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"overall the ipod really is an almost flawless beast . the capacity in the 20 gb is more than i think most people would ever need and , for the price , i highly recommend it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"everything else about the ipod is great , the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"finding all the albums , songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig ( well 18 gig ) worth of music .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it all sounds great too .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"you can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"for looks , well ipod is head and shoulders better , both the iriver and creative zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming ipod .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the ipod package comes with everything you need , the ac adaptor , firewire cable ( quicker than usb , but slower than usb 2 which it also gives ) , those snazzy and power full headphones , and of course the player .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"also , you have to use it with itunes - or they 'll sue , dammit ! . but itunes is about as good as anything .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the player is great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"all the `` cool `` features of the mini , but with 20gb instead of 5 .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"really easy to use .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousands of songs and organizes them great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"has a great helpline .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"they fix the problem and help you with whatever your i-pod needs comes with two usb ports and a charger .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"they are extremely convent and you don 't have to buy them seperately has i-tunes , which provides quality music at low prices .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the i-pod is the best thing i have ever used .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i found that to be the most impressive thing about the ipod 'mini ' - basically for ease of use , and the feel it gives .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this unit comes with the usb\/firewire cable as a standard item now .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i was worried about what the sound quality would be like , but that seems to be just as good as the actual cd sound .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i love the features on the ipod and the many things you can do with it .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i love the slim design ; . the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the ear buds that come with it look cheap , but the sound quality is amazing .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the click wheel is incredibly convenient , however it can be a little overly touchy at times , which will make you frustrated with your own fingers .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"way to go apple ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"nis 2003 worked like a charm last year .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"anti-spam is good","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the latest of internet security has antispam function that is helpful because i has received a mountain of those these days .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"but that is good for me because symantec soft wares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"sure , it slows it down a little , but that 's expected .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"perhaps semantic could work out the efficiency a little , but these reviews are highly exaggerated . . . i would ask what else these people are running on their computers ( ? . )","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this is the fourth version of systemworks and the second version of internet security that i have used and it has always been a favorite .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the antivirus feature is phenomenal , and is regularly updated .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i think their antivirus software was one of , if not the best , on the","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"their website had a download that helped remove those , although i had to manually remove a good number of files from the `` programs `` directory .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"norton 's memory usage on systems with 512 mb is very low .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i just got an older 866 mhz system with 512 pc 133 ram and it also runs fine on that .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"you won 't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"we were able to obtain a norton corporate edition of antivirus only ( no firewall or utilities ) and so far it 's great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've used the corporate edition at work without any problems ever .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"by the way , i use the norton 2003 corporate at work with absolutely no trouble .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"likewise , i 've heard norton 2004 professional version is fine too .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've been using nis 2004 for about 2 months and it works well .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the pop up blocker and anti-spam are bonuses .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i didn 't have any major problems installing this software .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"anyhow , this software is working fine and no problems since i installed it two weeks ago .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"mine installed no problem ( but i did uninstall my norton anti-virus 2002 & personal firewall 2002 first ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"seems to work great .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this did manage to cut the number of pop ups during start-up from 4 down to 2 .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"while it didn 't have all the features i would have liked , it was better than anything else i could find at the time .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"also , with one click you can help train your spam killer .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it 's a highly rated , kick ass firewall program that 's bundled with the venerable norton antivirus , plus extras ( like norton antispam & norton parental control ) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"luckily , with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing ! . it is indeed worth nothing .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of skate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great ! . .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the only free help you get is in renewing your subscription ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the product has worked perfectly for me on my xp .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"no more banner ads , pop-ups , and the reliable antivirus .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i work on word , explorer , netscape , acrobat reader , photoshop at same time ( meaning using a lot of memory ) , but still dont see a problem with computer ( getting slow or crashing ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"this product is way cooler than anything ive used before ( pencilings and maccabees and norton antivirus alone ) .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"5 stars all the way ! .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"all in all it hasn 't been a bad product .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i 've owned many norton products in my time , and for the most part , i 've been pleased with their performance .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i upgraded from nis 2003 , and the change in performance has not been noticeable .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"on the contrary , i 'm quite pleased with my upgrade .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"it works better and has more useful features than nis 2003 .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"the installation , set-up , and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i installed , activated and registered nis 2004 without issue .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"so far , the anti-spam feature seems to be very good .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
{"text":"i did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here .","label":1,"label_text":"positive"}
